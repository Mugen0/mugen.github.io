# Spatial - Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** Sept 21, 2025

This Terms of Service agreement ("**Agreement**") is a legal agreement between you ("**User**" or "**you**") and **HE Mugen** ("**Developer**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**"), the individual developer of the Spatial mobile application ("**App**").

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree with these terms, you must not use the App.

---

## 1. Description of Service

The App, "Spatial," is a tool that allows users to convert photos from their device's library into a format compatible with the Spatial Scene feature in iOS. The App's processing occurs locally on your device.

## 2. Privacy and Data Collection

Your privacy is extremely important to us.

- **No User Data Collection:** The App is designed to operate without collecting, storing, or transmitting any personal information or user data. We do not have a server that stores your information.

- **Photo Library Access:** To function, the App requires your explicit permission to access your device's photo library. This access is used **solely** for the purpose of selecting photos for processing and saving the converted output back to your library. **We do not access, view, or transmit your photos or photo library content to any external service or server.** All processing is performed locally on your device.

- **Network Access:** The App requires an internet connection **only** for one purpose: to communicate with Apple's App Store servers to verify the status of your active subscription, as managed through Apple's In-App Purchase system. This process is essential for maintaining access to premium features and does not involve transmitting your personal data.

For more details, please review our [Privacy Policy](link-to-your-privacy-policy).

## 3. Intellectual Property Rights

- **Our Rights:** The App, including all source code, databases, functionality, software, designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics (collectively, the "**Content**"), and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the "**Marks**"), are owned or controlled by the Developer and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

- **Your Content:** You retain all rights to the original photos you import into the App. By using the App, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to process your images locally on your device solely for the purpose of providing the conversion service. This license terminates automatically when you delete the photo from the App or delete the App itself.

## 4. Subscription and Payments

- **Auto-Renewal:** The App may offer premium features through a subscription-based model via In-App Purchases. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

- **Management:** You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase. Any fees charged are non-refundable, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

- **Free Trial:** If we offer a free trial, any unused portion will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

> **THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE DEVELOPER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE.**

## 6. Limitation of Liability

> **TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPER, HE MUGEN, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP, EVEN IF THE DEVELOPER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.**

## 7. Changes to this Agreement

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. We will provide notice of changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Agreement. By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

## 8. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your country of residence, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
