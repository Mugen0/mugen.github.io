# **Spatial - Privacy Policy**

**Last Updated:** Sept 21, 2025

HE Mugen ("we," "us," or "our") built the Spatial app ("App") on a freemium model. This means the free version of the app allows you to perform a limited number of conversion tasks, while the paid subscription provides unlimited access to all features without any usage restrictions.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our App.

**If you choose to use our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.**

#### **1. Information Collection and Use**

The App is designed to operate with a fundamental principle: **Your data stays on your device.**

*   **No Personal Data Collection:** We do not knowingly collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information ("PII") such as your name, address, email address, or phone number.
*   **No Analytics or Tracking:** We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook SDK) that collect data about your usage of the App.
*   **Photos (Photo Library Access):** The App requires access to your device's photo library to function. This access is used **solely** for the purpose of:
    *   Allowing you to select photos for processing.
    *   Saving the converted output photo back to your library.
    *   **Crucially: All image processing is performed locally on your device. We do not have access to your photos, we cannot view them, and they are never transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers.**
*   **Network Access (Internet Permission):** The App requires an internet connection for one specific purpose:
    *   To communicate with **Apple's App Store servers** to verify the status of your active subscription and complete In-App Purchases. This is a standard process managed entirely by Apple, and we do not intercept or store any financial information you provide to Apple.

#### **2. Log Data**

We want to inform you that whenever you use our App, **we do not collect any data or information** through so-called "Log Data" on your device. There are no error logs or usage statistics sent to us.

#### **3. Cookies**

This App does not use "cookies".

#### **4. Service Providers**

We do not employ third-party companies or individuals to facilitate our Service, provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. The only external service we interact with is **Apple's App Store**, for the exclusive purpose of handling subscriptions, as governed by Apple's own Privacy Policy.

#### **5. Security**

We value your trust. Since we do not collect your personal data, the security of your information is primarily governed by the security of your own iOS device. We recommend you use all security features provided by Apple (e.g., passcode, Face ID, Touch ID).

#### **6. Links to Other Sites**

This App does not contain links to other sites.

#### **7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13\. Since we collect no data, this risk is eliminated.

#### **8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

#### **9. Your Rights (CCPA & GDPR)**

Even though we do not collect your data, we support the principles of data protection regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You have the right to:
*   **Access:** Know what personal data is collected. In our case: none.
*   **Deletion:** Request deletion of personal data. In our case: there is nothing to delete from our servers.
*   **Opt-Out:** Opt-out of the sale of personal data. We do not sell data.

Since all data remains on your device, to exercise any right related to your photos, you can manage them directly through your iOS Photo app.
